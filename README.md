hello-world
===========

Just another repository.
I'm Dan. I know a little bit of HTML, CSS, Java, C++, Batch, Bash, and Pig Latin.
That last one's not really for programming, but it's equally confusing to people who don't know it! :D
I also know French, but that doesn't really have to do with computers...
